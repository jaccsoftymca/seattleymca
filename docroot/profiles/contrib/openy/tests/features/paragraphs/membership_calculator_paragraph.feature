      | title                               | Behat branch  |

      | :lng                                | -122.238717   |
      | field_location_phone                | +1234567890   |
    And I create paragraph of type membership_info:
      | KEY               | field_mbrshp_location | field_mbrshp_join_fee | field_mbrshp_monthly_rate | field_mbrshp_link:uri | :title |

      | family_1_image | family_1.jpg | family_1.jpg      |
      | family_2_image | family_2.jpg | family_2.jpg      |
    And I create membership content:
      | KEY          | title           | status | field_mbrshp_description:value                                | :format   | field_mbrshp_info | field_mbrshp_image |
