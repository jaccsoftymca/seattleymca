Feature: Branch Content type
  As Admin I want to make sure that Branch content type is available with needed fields.

  Background: Branch test setup
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Editor" role
    And I create media of type image:
      | KEY              | name             | field_media_image |
      | image_01         | Image 01         | image_01.png      |
    And I create large paragraph of type banner:
      | KEY                    | behat_banner_01      | behat_banner_02      | behat_banner_03      |
      | field_prgf_headline    | BEHAT BANNER 01      | BEHAT BANNER 02      | BEHAT BANNER 03      |
      | field_prgf_image       | image_01             | image_01             | image_01             |
      | field_prgf_description | BEHAT DESCRIPTION 01 | BEHAT DESCRIPTION 02 | BEHAT DESCRIPTION 03 |
      | field_prgf_link:uri    | http://openymca.org  | http://openymca.org  | http://openymca.org  |
      | :title                 | Read about OpenY     | Read about OpenY     | Read about OpenY     |
    And I create large branch content:
      | KEY                                 | behat_branch    |
      | title                               | BEHAT BRANCH    |
      | field_location_address:country_code | US              |
      | :address_line1                      | Main road 10    |
      | :locality                           | Seattle         |
      | :administrative_area                | WA              |
      | :postal_code                        | 98101           |
      | field_location_coordinates:lat      | 47.293433       |
      | :lng                                | -122.238717     |
      | field_location_phone                | +1234567890     |
      | field_header_content                | behat_banner_01 |
      | field_content                       | behat_banner_02 |
      | field_bottom_content                | behat_banner_03 |

  Scenario: Create basic branch
    Given I go to "/node/add/branch"
    And I fill in "Title" with "Branch One"
    And I fill in the following:
      | Street address | Main road 10   |
      | City           | Seattle        |
      | State          | WA             |
      | Zip code       | 98101          |
      | Latitude       | 47.293433      |
      | Longitude      | -122.238717    |
      | Phone          | +1234567890    |
    When I press "Save and publish"
    Then I should see the message "Branch Branch One has been created."

  Scenario: I see appropriate content on branch
    Given I view node "behat_branch"
    Then I should see "BEHAT BRANCH"
    And I should see "Main road 10"
    And I should see "98101"
    And I should see "WA"
    And I should see "Seattle"
    And I should see "+1234567890"
    And I should see "BEHAT BANNER 01"
    And I should see "BEHAT DESCRIPTION 01"
    And I should see "BEHAT BANNER 02"
    And I should see "BEHAT DESCRIPTION 02"
    And I should see "BEHAT BANNER 03"
    And I should see "BEHAT DESCRIPTION 03"
